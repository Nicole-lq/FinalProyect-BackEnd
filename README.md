## Project Description

This challenge involves using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Java 17 to develop a REST API that allows users to manage topics in a forum. The application includes functionalities for creating, displaying, updating, and deleting topics, implementing security practices with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Additionally, Insomnia is used to test the endpoints and MySQL for data persistence.
